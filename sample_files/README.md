# Creating Sample Files

The files in this directory are for documentation. They are a copy of the autogenerated files when running:

```bash
./build_run_docker.sh <other args> --save-sample-files
```

They thereby all belong to the same cluster configuration, which is documented in [parsed_arguments.txt](parsed_arguments.txt).
